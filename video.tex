This is our plan for the video:


* The general theme of the video will be what makes Dart interesting/our project. I think the most interesting part about Dart is how it is used heavily in mobile development, so I think the video will focus a lot on that part.

* The main idea I want to get across in the video is the interesting parts of the project we worked on and what makes Dart useful
in comparison to other programming languages. I think the most useful part about Dart is how it is used in the Flutter framework for app development

* The code samples I want to show will be primarily related to mobile app development. I have a small sample program written in Android Studio and I can show the code for that.

* We will demo the program by playing a few rounds of our Tic Tac Toe game and we will show off the extra features we added
such as player vs player functionality and AI vs AI functionality and difficulty settings. 

* We plan on shooting the video by capturing our screens using some sort of screen recording software and then we will edit it together using Adobe.
